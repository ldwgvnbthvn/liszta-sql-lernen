# Starting SQL
There are many RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) out there, but here I wiil use PostgreSQL


## Basic Commands
NOTES: SQL are not case sensitive (as I know), so `select` and `SELECT` will be the same. <br/>
Also... SQL is always ended with `;` <br/>
Create database: <br/>
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```
Create table: <br/>
**Get data from database**: `SELECT`
